## Attempting
Implement QSFDI wherever possible

## List of Work
- [ ] PRESSURE_SMOOTH: If QSFDI fails for a node, the switch to MLS. If MLS fails it will do Shephard fnc.
- [ ] interp_IQSFDI_shapeFun_3D_Wei: 
	- [x] Parallel compatible. Used OMP REDUCTION. Important speedup
	- [ ] Remove local allocations [link](#log_wbqml01_v0003_4)

## OMP Local allocation of large matrix vs passing them as argument [2022-05-31]

- DRYAN in his QSFDI function allocated many matrices to the size of NN, where NN is the number of neighs

- I usually follow the practice of instead allocating a chunk of size NLMAX and passing all these temp matrices as an argument in the function

- I tested the two to see which is faster

- For local allocation within the function, OMP will make separate copies for each thread so thats not a problem

- It appears repeated allocation and deallocation is faster than passing large chunk NLMAX (surprised)
	- This practice is definitely more convenient. But I didnt think it'll be faster.

## QSFDI applied for pressure smoothing [2022-05-27]

- The trials with DRYAN_SFDI for pressure smoothing had failed.
	- Likely due to the large error in interpolation of SFDI, verified by a single point test

- The single point test for DRYAN_QSFDI revealed an excellent interpolation, given sufficiently large support domain.

- So I applied DRYAN_QSFDI to pressure smoothing. It worked very well. <br> Results: `Test_yansfdi_caseS1a_both/bqml71SFD_caseS1a_dx050_dt008_L35_L1p50R1p50_Walt_Long`
	- Note: It was applied only to fluid particles
	- Note: MLS was applied to NWID3EQ9 and wall particles.
	- Ran it for the Bsnq-cpled case with L1.50R1.50
	- It failed after 8900+ time-steps. (My earlier runs with my SFDI had failed after 8600+ time-steps)
		- The reason is particle concentration in the relaxation zone.

- Issue of determinant = 0 still persists.
	- I noticed that at times the errState=3 was reported out the the QSFDI function
	- The determinant was going =0 mostly at wall edges with poor particle distribution.
	- Can likely address this by increasing the radius.
	- It is a bug state that should be resolved, possibly by doing MLS for the nodes where this fails or maybe increasing the radius by a little bit un-till it works.

## Observations so far [2022-05-26]

The SFDI implementation by me and DRYAN are quite different

- Radius in weiFnc: If calculation is being done for INOD
	- DRYAN: Radius in weiFnc = R(INOD). <br> The concept that the domain of dependece is a user specified sphere.
	- Me: Radius in weiFnc = (R(NEI) + R(INOD)) / 2. <br> The concept that the domain of dependence of the location is a sum of domain of influence of the neighbours.

- Some other difference. I have followed the Ma (2008) paper exactly. DRYAN has not done that way.

- **My SFDI implementation works very well for the smoothing of pressure. DRYAN SFDI does not work well for smoothing of pressure.**

- While doing calculation at INOD, DRYAN excludes the INOD for SFDI and QSFDI in the list of neighbours. <br> I include INOD in neighbour list always.


General guidelines about DRYAN library of SFDI, QSFDI

- Support domain is a sphere of user specified radius around the point of calculation. Hence the radius in the weiFnc = R(INOD)

- While doing calculation at INOD, DRYAN excludes the INOD for SFDI and QSFDI in the list of neighbours. <br> If you include INOD in list of neighs then the function will return the shp with value 1 for INOD and 0 for rest all.

- Interpolation by SFDI was quite poor actually. Interpolation by QSFDI seems very good. Comment based on interpolation at a single point.
	- Due to this the interpolation of pressure by YAN_SFDI kept breaking down soon after like 2500 steps. (Trying with QSFDI to see if its gonna be better)
